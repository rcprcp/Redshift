# Redshift
AWS Redshift sample programs

you'll also need to set up a database.ini file like this one: 

````
[redshift]                                                                                                              
host=test1.tthrd3swa3t.us-earth-2.redshift.amazonaws.com
database=dev
port=5439
user=awsuser
password=MyPassword14
````
